  <h2>About the Character Creation Utility</h2>
  <p>The Character Creation Utility is for creating characters for
    Monte Cook Games' Numenera pen-and-paper role-playing game. You can
    create characters, advance them, and produce a printable character
    record for them.</p>
  <h3>Isn't there an official app for this? If so, why another one?</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://3lbgames.com/games/numenera-character-creator/">There
      certainly is.</a> I made this mostly because it was fun, and coding up
    the game mechanics was a good way to learn them. However, I also
    wanted something that produced printable character sheets, since I
    don't like people messing with their personal electronics while
    playing.

  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <p>Click around. You'll figure it out.</p>
  <h3>What's with the splats on some descriptors, like Mutant*?</h3>
  <p>They're from the optional rules section of the Corebook, and
    the app doesn't support their special characteristics. You can't,
    for example, pick your mutations here. Some of them affect your
    stats, which makes this app less than ideal for designing them. I
    left in because they're fun to explore anyway.</p>
  <h3>What is it made of?</h3>
  <p>
    It is an offline-capable all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with
    the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your desktop for
    it (the button just to the left of the address field), it will run
    in full-screen, which is kind of nice.
  </p>
  <h3>Do you collect any data?</h3>
  <p>No, other than usual web server traffic logging. If you link to
    characters you've shared, that request and its query string does get
    logged in the web server's HTTP logs.</p>
  <h3>So where do my saved characters go?</h3>
  <p>In your browser's local data store. That means they'll only be
    available on the browser you used to create them. You can share them
    by copy-pasting links, though.</p>
  <h3>Will I lose the characters if I empty my history, clear my
    cache, and remove my cookies?</h3>
  <p>The details depend on your browser, but yeah, you most likely
    will.</p>
  <h3>Any way I can "back up" my characters?</h3>
  <p>Bookmark the "Share (character name)" link. Be warned that I may
    break data compatibility without warning (although I try not to),
    so save PDF's or make prints. That's your only real backup.</p>
  <h3>Anything else about my saved characters?</h3>
  <p>Don't trust this app. I try to maintain back compatibility for
    characters, but this version is still unfinished and it may break.
    I may also take it offline at any time. Keep those prints.</p>
  <h3>Any gotchas with the printable character sheet?</h3>
  <p>It seems to work OK on Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome at least.
    Just turn off the headers and footers in Firefox.</p>
  <h3>Your webapp icon sucks and I have a better one. Where can I
    reach you?</h3>
  <p>
    You'll find me on <a
      href="http://ninthworldhub.com/forum/topics/character-creation-utility">Ninth
      World Hub,</a> as Petteri Sulonen. I won't leave my e-mail here
    because spam and stuff.
  </p>
  <h3>Is this an official Numenera product?</h3>
  <p>No way! Numenera is &copy; Monte Cook Games LLC. The Character
    Creation Utility is an unofficial fan project by me, Petteri
    Sulonen. I may take it off-line at any time, for any reason, in
    particular if MCG asks me to, so don't rely on it too much.</p>
  <h3>Why isn't this on GitHub?</h3>
  <p>Because Monte Cook Games hasn't yet come up with a license for
    fan created content and I don't want to tread on their toes. I
    believe that what I'm doing here falls under 'fair use' as I'm only
    using mechanics (which can't be copyrighted) and individual phrases
    (which are too small to be copyrighted), and in any case the thing's
    fairly useless for anyone who isn't already playing Numenera, or
    wants to. However, I like them and if they feel I'm doing them harm,
    I will take this down.</p>
