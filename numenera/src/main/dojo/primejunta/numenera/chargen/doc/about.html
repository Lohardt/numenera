  <h2>About the Character Creation Utility</h2>
  <p>The Character Creation Utility is for creating characters for Monte Cook Games' Numenera pen-and-paper role-playing game. You can create characters, advance them, and produce a printable character record for them.</p>
  <h3>Isn't there an official app for this? If so, why another one?</h3>
  <p><a href="http://3lbgames.com/games/numenera-character-creator/">There certainly is.</a> I made this mostly because it was fun, and coding up the game mechanics was a good way to learn them. However, I also wanted something that produced printable character sheets, since I don't like people messing with their personal electronics while playing.</p>
  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <p>Click around. You'll figure it out.</p>
  <h3>What is it made of?</h3>
  <p>It is an offline-capable all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Tip:</b> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your desktop for it (the button just to the left of the address field), it will run in full-screen, which is kind of nice.</p>
  <h3>Do you collect any data?</h3>
  <p>No, other than usual web server traffic logging. If you link to characters you've shared, that request and its query string does get logged in the web server's HTTP logs.</p>
  <h3>So where do my saved characters go?</h3>
  <p>In your browser's local data store. That means they'll only be available on the browser you used to create them. You can share them by copy-pasting links, though.</p>
  <h3>Will I lose the characters if I empty my history, clear my cache, and remove my cookies?</h3>
  <p>The details depend on your browser, but yeah, you most likely will.</p>
  <h3>Any way I can "back up" my characters?</h3>
  <p>Bookmark the "Share (character name)" link. That won't help if I've updated the app to break data compatibility again. The primary purpose of this app (at this point) is to easily fill out and print a character sheet; that's your real backup.</p>
  <h3>Anything else about my saved characters?</h3>
  <p>Don't trust this app. I try to maintain back compatibility for characters, but this version is still unfinished and it may break.</p>
  <h3>Any gotchas with the printable character sheet?</h3>
  <p>It seems to work OK on Firefox and Google Chrome, but Firefox prints ugly headers and footers on it. For best results, use Chrome.</p>
  <h3>Your webapp icon sucks and I have a better one. Where can I reach you?</h3>
  <p>You'll find me on <a href="http://ninthworldhub.com/forum/topics/character-creation-utility">Ninth World Hub,</a> as Petteri Sulonen. I won't leave my e-mail here because spam and stuff.</p>
  <h3>Is this an official Numenera product?</h3>
  <p>No way! Numenera is &copy; Monte Cook Games LLC. The Character Creation Utility is an unofficial fan project by me, Petteri Sulonen. I may take it off-line at any time, for any reason, in particular if MCG asks me to, so don't rely on it too much.</p>
