  <h1>About the Character Creation Utility</h1>
  <p>The Character Creation Utility is for creating characters for
    Monte Cook Games' Numenera pen-and-paper role-playing game. You can
    create characters, advance them, and produce a printable character
    record for them.</p>
  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <p>
    Make a hero. Store her with the <i class="fa fa-save"></i> button.
    Once you're ready to take her into play, click on the <i
      class="fa fa-angle-double-up"></i> <b>Advance</b> button at top
    right. This locks in her characteristics and you can only modify
    them according to the rules. You can change possessions and notes
    though.
  </p>
  <h3>Can I back up or save my characters?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, and you should. The backup features are in the Character
    Manager pane behind the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> button.
    You can download backups into files, or if you have a Google
    Drive&trade; account, you can back them up to that. In fact Google
    Drive is currently the only practical backup method if you're using
    an iPad, which doesn't really have file download and upload
    features.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <i>You</i> want access to my Google Drive?!?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It's the only way I'm able to send your backups there. But I
    understand if you don't trust me. See the <a
      href="primejunta/cypher/doc/privacy.html" target="privacyPolicyWindow">Privacy
      Policy</a> for more on this.
  </p>
  <h3>Sharing characters</h3>
  <p>If you have a Google Drive, you can import and export
    characters to and from any devices you use using the Character
    Manager's backup to cloud and restore from cloud features.</p>
  <p>
    If you want to share a character publicly or with someone else, open
    the Character Manager pane from the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i>
    button. You can display each of the characters as links from there.
    These are normal Web links, which you can bookmark, mail, post on a
    forum message, or whatever.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What's the little <i class="fa fa-fullscreen"></i> button?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It's an in-play view of the character. You can do some stuff like
    track stat pool depletion, do recovery rolls and such. It has its
    own help pane in the <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> tab.
  </p>
  <h3>"Ward" is supposed to improve my Armor but I don't see it in
    the stats pane. What gives?</h3>
  <p>
    Check the <i class="fa fa-fullscreen"></i> Play View or the <i
      class="fa fa-print"></i> Print View. Bonuses from selected
    abilities like esoteries and mutations will get applied to the
    character sheet, but they won't yet appear in the "editor." If I've
    missed something, please let me know.
  </p>
  <h3>What do those circled letters mean?</h3>
  <p>Ⓣrained, Ⓢpecialized, Ⓔnabler, Ⓐbility, Ⓘnability, Ⓛight,
    Ⓜedium, Ⓗeavy, Ⓑashing, Ⓒutting (or Ⓒleaving if you prefer), Ⓡanged,
    and ⓐsset.</p>
  <p>I substituted Ⓒutting for ⓑladed because Ⓑashing also starts
    with a Ⓑ.</p>
  <h3>What's with the splats on some descriptors, like Mutant*?</h3>
  <p>They're from the optional rules section of the Corebook, and
    it's up to your GM to allow them (or not), and to approve any
    mutations your mutant may have. If entering the data manually, there
    are sometimes more fields available than you need; just leave the
    ones you don't need empty, and they'll go away once you advance your
    hero. If you make up your own mutations with stat penalties, just
    enter negative values into the boxes.</p>
  <h3>Isn't there an official app for this? If so, why another one?</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://3lbgames.com/games/numenera-character-creator/">There
      certainly is.</a> I made this mostly because it was fun, and coding up
    the game mechanics was a good way to learn them. However, I also
    wanted something that produced printable character sheets, since I
    don't like people messing with their personal electronics while
    playing.
  </p>
  <h3>What is it made of?</h3>
  <p>
    It is an offline-capable all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with
    the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your desktop for
    it (the button just to the left of the address field), it will run
    in full-screen, which is kind of nice. You can even bookmark each of
    your characters this way.
  </p>
  <h3>I found a bug/omission/error some other issue!</h3>
  <p>Let me know about it (see below), and I'll see what I can do.</p>
  <h3>It doesn't work on my browser!</h3>
  <p>
    I test this (not as well as I'd like) on Google Chrome, Mozilla
    Firefox, and Apple Safari, on a Mac and an iPad, and occasionally on
    an oldish Samsung tablet running Android. That's about all I can
    manage. If you want to submit a patch, do it on <a
      href="https://github.com/PrimeJunta/numenera.git">GitHub.</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Do you collect any data?</h3>
  <p>No, other than usual web server traffic logging. If you link to
    characters you've shared, that request and its query string does get
    logged in the web server's HTTP logs. Backups (to file or to Google
    Drive) do not go through my web server at all, so I'll never know
    about those.</p>
  <h3>So where do my saved characters go?</h3>
  <p>
    In your browser's local data store. That means they'll only be
    available on the browser you used to create them. You can share them
    by copy-pasting links, syncing with Google Drive, or downloading and
    uploading backup files (from the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i>
    pane).
  </p>
  <h3>Will I lose the characters if I empty my history, clear my
    cache, and remove my cookies?</h3>
  <p>The details depend on your browser, but yeah, you most likely
    will.</p>
  <h3>Any gotchas with the printable character sheet?</h3>
  <p>It seems to work OK on Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome at
    least. Just turn off the headers and footers in Firefox.</p>
  <h3>How closely does this follow the Rules as Written?</h3>
  <p>I've done my best to code in the rules as written. In case of
    ambiguity, I've erred on the side of greater permissiveness, on the
    grounds that the GM can always restrict your choices whereas she
    can't do much about the app. I've also left as much open as
    possible, so for example you can adjust shins and add or remove
    equipment freely, make up your own skills and mutations and so on.</p>
  <p>One fairly important thing is stated two ways in the Corebook.
    On page 24 it says that you can purchase one of several alternatives
    instead of training in a skill when advancing your character. On
    page 112 it says that purchasing one of the alternatives counts
    toward any of your tier advancement requirements. I've used the
    stricter interpretation, because I didn't notice the other one until
    it was too late. Now it would be difficult to change without
    breaking character compatibility, so I probably won't.</p>
  <p>The single most debatable call I've made has to do with
    specialization in a combat skill. The rules governing this are
    somewhat complex and somewhat ambiguous, with some fairly strict
    restrictions on who is allowed to specialize in an attack or defense
    skill, and when.</p>
  <p>The basic version is simple enough: glaives get attack skills
    and jacks get defense skills; they get to train in them from tier 2
    and 1 on respectively, and specialize from tier 5 on. However, some
    descriptors and foci also grant attack and defense skills "for
    free." So what do we do, say, with a Graceful jack who gets Speed
    Defense from Graceful?</p>
  <p>A strict reading of the rules states that the jack is not
    allowed to take Speed Defense on tiering up until Tier 5, because
    she is already trained in it. However, this leads to a number of
    problems. Therefore, I have interpreted the rules loosely: I allow
    specialization in a skill if and once you receive it as a bonus from
    your descriptor or focus. There are three reasons for this call.</p>
  <p>First, it maintains character differentiation: our Graceful
    jack may retain her distinguishing advantage in Speed Defense
    relative to other characters even as she tiers up, and the other
    characters are able to pick Speed Defense as a tier perk.</p>
  <p>Second, this is not as big a difference with the strict reading
    as it appears at first glance. Many descriptors and foci grant
    defense (and sometimes attack) skills that are conditional and
    definitely do give specialization when the conditions apply; Trained
    Without Armor for example stacks with Speed Defense, giving
    Specialized in that when, well, without armor. So allowing "liberal"
    defense skill stacking doesn't change things as much as it might
    look at first glance.</p>
  <p>
    And third, enforcing the strict limits would have resulted in some
    collisions. For example, Masters Defense gets Intellect Defense for
    free on Tier 4, which jacks can pick as an ability any time before
    that, but are normally only allowed to specialize in it on Tier 5.
    So is a jack who picked it earlier specialized when he gets it from
    his focus, or not? If he is, then would he be allowed to pick it <i>after</i>
    receiving it from the focus, as a Tier 4 Trick of the Trade or
    purchased ability? If not, why the difference? In other words, I
    would have gotten into a mess of more judgment calls and more
    scripting to handle each potential collision in a fairly big matrix
    (descriptor, focus, type, tier-up bonus perk, tier-up bought perk).
    That, I'm fairly certain, would have just made things worse.
  </p>
  <p>In any case, this interpretation, like everything else, must
    ultimately be arbitrated by your GM and your group. If you want to
    enforce the strict interpretation, by all means do so – simply don't
    take any of the problematic skills until the strict reading says
    you're allowed to.</p>
  <h3>I found a way to cheat!</h3>
  <p>Well bully for you. The validation checks on your character are
    intended to stop innocent mistakes. You can probably find ways
    around them if you try. In any case it's up to your GM to approve
    any character you roll up.</p>
  <p>That said, if you find a mistake or omission in the checks,
    please let me know and I'll see if I can fix it.</p>
