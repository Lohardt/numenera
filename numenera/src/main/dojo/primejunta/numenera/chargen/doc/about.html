  <h2>About the Character Creation Utility</h2>
  <p>The Character Creation Utility is for creating characters for
    Monte Cook Games' Numenera pen-and-paper role-playing game. You can
    create characters, advance them, and produce a printable character
    record for them.</p>
  <h3>Isn't there an official app for this? If so, why another one?</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="http://3lbgames.com/games/numenera-character-creator/">There
      certainly is.</a> I made this mostly because it was fun, and coding up
    the game mechanics was a good way to learn them. However, I also
    wanted something that produced printable character sheets, since I
    don't like people messing with their personal electronics while
    playing.
  </p>
  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <p>Make a hero. Store her with the "Save" button. Once you're
    ready to advance her, click on the "Advance" button at bottom right.
    This locks in her characteristics and you can only modify them
    according to the rules. You can change possessions and notes though.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> You can bookmark each of your heroes individually, for
    example on an iPad desktop, or manage them with the Saved Characters
    feature.
  </p>
  <h3>"Ward" is supposed to improve my Armor but I don't see it in
    the stats pane. What gives?</h3>
  <p>Check the printable character sheet. Bonuses from selected
    abilities like esoteries and mutations will get applied to the
    character sheet, but they won't yet appear in the "editor." If I've
    missed something, please let me know.</p>
  <h3>What do those circled letters mean?</h3>
  <p>Ⓣrained, Ⓢpecialized, Ⓔnabler, Ⓐbility, Ⓘnability, Ⓛight,
    Ⓜedium, Ⓗeavy, Ⓑashing, Ⓒutting (or Ⓒleaving if you prefer), Ⓡanged,
    and ⓐsset.</p>
    <p>I substituted Ⓒutting for ⓑladed because Ⓑashing also starts with a
    Ⓑ. (Personally I would've picked Ⓒrushing, Ⓑladed, and Ⓡanged, but
    eh.)</p>
  <h3>What's with the splats on some descriptors, like Mutant*?</h3>
  <p>They're from the optional rules section of the Corebook, and
    it's up to your GM to allow them (or not), and they need more work
    to set up. You can set your mutant's mutations, but you need to look
    them up. There are sometimes more fields available than you need;
    just leave the ones you don't need empty, and they'll go away once
    you advance your hero. If you make up your own mutations with stat
    penalties, just enter negative values into the boxes. They're provided
    for Beneficial and Distinctive mutations.</p>
  <h3>What is it made of?</h3>
  <p>
    It is an offline-capable all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with
    the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your desktop for
    it (the button just to the left of the address field), it will run
    in full-screen, which is kind of nice. You can even bookmark each of
    your characters this way.
  </p>
  <h3>It doesn't work on my browser!</h3>
  <p>I test this (not as well as I'd like) on Google Chrome, Mozilla
    Firefox, and Apple Safari, on a Mac and an iPad, and occasionally on
    an oldish Samsung tablet running Android. That's about all I can
    manage. If you're running some other browser and something doesn't
    work, please submit a patch.</p>
  <p>
    <b>N.b.:</b> If/when the licensing issues are sorted out, I want to
    put this on GitHub, at which point this will become much easier.
  </p>
  <h3>Do you collect any data?</h3>
  <p>No, other than usual web server traffic logging. If you link to
    characters you've shared, that request and its query string does get
    logged in the web server's HTTP logs.</p>
  <h3>So where do my saved characters go?</h3>
  <p>In your browser's local data store. That means they'll only be
    available on the browser you used to create them. You can share them
    by copy-pasting links, though.</p>
  <h3>Will I lose the characters if I empty my history, clear my
    cache, and remove my cookies?</h3>
  <p>The details depend on your browser, but yeah, you most likely
    will.</p>
  <h3>Any way I can "back up" my characters?</h3>
  <p>Bookmark the "Share (character name)" link. Also don't trust
    random things on the Internet, so make prints and/or save them as
    PDF's. I don't want responsibility for keeping your characters safe!</p>
  <h3>Any gotchas with the printable character sheet?</h3>
  <p>It seems to work OK on Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome at
    least. Just turn off the headers and footers in Firefox.</p>
  <h3>I found a way to cheat!</h3>
  <p>Well bully for you. The validation checks on your character are
    intended to stop innocent mistakes. You can probably find ways
    around them if you try. In any case it's up to your GM to approve
    any character you roll up.</p>
  <p>That said, if you find a mistake or omission in the checks,
    please let me know and I'll see if I can fix it.</p>
  <h3>So how do I reach you?</h3>
  <p>
    You'll find me on <a
      href="http://ninthworldhub.com/forum/topics/character-creation-utility">Ninth
      World Hub,</a> as Petteri Sulonen. I won't leave my e-mail here
    because spam and stuff. I hope to put this on GitHub once Monte Cook
    Games gets a community usage license up (assuming they won't shut
    the project down before then).
  </p>
  <h3>Is this an official Numenera product?</h3>
  <p>No way! Numenera is &copy; Monte Cook Games LLC. The Character
    Creation Utility is an unofficial fan project by me, Petteri
    Sulonen. I may take it off-line at any time, for any reason, in
    particular if MCG asks me to, so don't rely on it too much.</p>
  <h3>Why isn't this on GitHub?</h3>
  <p>Because Monte Cook Games hasn't yet come up with a license for
    fan created content and I don't want to tread on their toes. I
    believe that what I'm doing here falls under 'fair use' as I'm only
    using mechanics (which can't be copyrighted) and individual phrases
    (which are too small to be copyrighted), and in any case the thing's
    fairly useless for anyone who isn't already playing Numenera, or
    wants to. However, I like them and if they feel I'm doing them harm,
    I will take this down.</p>
