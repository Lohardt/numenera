  <h1>Technical Matters</h1>
  <p>
    The Character Geneartion Utility is an offline-capable
    all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with the <a
      href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your
    desktop for it (the button just to the left of the address field),
    it will run in full-screen, which is kind of nice. You can even
    bookmark each of your characters this way.
  </p>
  <h2>Can I back up or save my characters?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, and you should. The backup features are in the Character
    Manager pane behind the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> button.
    You can download backups into files, or if you have a Google
    Drive&trade; account, you can back them up to that. In fact Google
    Drive is currently the only practical backup method if you're using
    an iPad, which doesn't really have file download and upload
    features.
  </p>
  <h2>
    <i>You</i> want access to my Google Drive?!?
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's the only way I'm able to send your backups there. But I
    understand if you don't trust me. See the <a
      href="primejunta/cypher/doc/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for
    more on this.
  </p>
  <h2>What does the Google Drive thing actually do?</h2>
  <p>It creates and updates files with a special MIME type on your
    Google Drive, with the filename you've specified in the Character
    Store. They appear at the root. You can move them wherever you like.</p>
  <h2>How do I delete a Google Drive backup or sync file?</h2>
  <p>From your Google Drive itself, not here. I don't do that simply
    because if I have no delete operations, then I can't make a
    terrible, disastrous mistake in using one.</p>
  <h2>Sharing characters</h2>
  <p>If you have a Google Drive, you can import and export
    characters to and from any devices you use using the Character
    Manager's backup to cloud and restore from cloud features.</p>
  <p>
    If you want to share a character publicly or with someone else, open
    the Character Manager pane from the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i>
    button. You can display each of the characters as links from there.
    These are normal Web links, which you can bookmark, mail, post on a
    forum message, or whatever.
  </p>
  <h2>Isn't there an official app for this? If so, why another one?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://3lbgames.com/games/numenera-character-creator/">There
      certainly is.</a> I made this mostly because it was fun, and coding up
    the game mechanics was a good way to learn them. However, I also
    wanted something that produced printable character sheets, since I
    don't like people messing with their personal electronics while
    playing.
  </p>
  <h2>What is it made of?</h2>
  <p>
    It is an offline-capable all-Javascript/HTML/CSS webapp written with
    the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> If you're on an iPad and make a link on your desktop for
    it (the button just to the left of the address field), it will run
    in full-screen, which is kind of nice. You can even bookmark each of
    your characters this way.
  </p>
  <h2>Will I lose the characters if I empty my history, clear my
    cache, and remove my cookies?</h2>
  <p>The details depend on your browser, but yeah, you most likely
    will. So make backups.</p>
  <h2>So where do my saved characters go?</h2>
  <p>
    In your browser's local data store. That means they'll only be
    available on the browser you used to create them. You can share them
    by copy-pasting links, syncing with Google Drive, or downloading and
    uploading backup files (from the <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i>
    pane).
  </p>
  <h2>I found a bug/omission/error some other issue!</h2>
  <p>Let me know about it (see below), and I'll see what I can do.</p>
  <h2>It doesn't work on my browser!</h2>
  <p>
    I test this (not as well as I'd like) on Google Chrome, Mozilla
    Firefox, and Apple Safari, on a Mac and an iPad, and occasionally on
    an oldish Samsung tablet running Android. That's about all I can
    manage. If you want to submit a patch, do it on <a
      href="https://github.com/PrimeJunta/numenera.git">GitHub.</a>
  </p>
  <h2>Do you collect any data?</h2>
  <p>
    No, other than usual web server traffic logging. If you link to
    characters you've shared, that request and its query string does get
    logged in the web server's HTTP logs. Backups (to file or to Google
    Drive) do not go through my web server at all, so I'll never know
    about those. See the <a href="primejunta/cypher/doc/privacy.html">Privacy
      Policy</a> for more information.
