  <h1>How closely does this follow the Rules as Written?</h1>
  <p>I've done my best to code in the rules as written. In case of
    ambiguity, I've erred on the side of greater permissiveness, on the
    grounds that the GM can always restrict your choices whereas she
    can't do much about the app. I've also left as much open as
    possible, so for example you can adjust shins and add or remove
    equipment freely, make up your own skills and mutations and so on.</p>
  <h2>Tier Advancement Options</h2>
  <p>One fairly important thing is stated two ways in the Corebook.
    On page 24 it says that you can purchase one of several alternatives
    instead of training in a skill when advancing your character. On
    page 112 it says that purchasing one of the alternatives counts
    toward any of your tier advancement requirements. I've used the
    stricter interpretation, because I didn't notice the other one until
    it was too late. Now it would be difficult to change without
    breaking character compatibility, so I probably won't.</p>
  <h2>Combat Skill Specialization</h2>
  <p>The single most debatable call I've made has to do with
    specialization in a combat skill. The rules governing this are
    somewhat complex and somewhat ambiguous, with some fairly strict
    restrictions on who is allowed to specialize in an attack or defense
    skill, and when.</p>
  <p>The basic version is simple enough: glaives get attack skills
    and jacks get defense skills; they get to train in them from tier 2
    and 1 on respectively, and specialize from tier 5 on. However, some
    descriptors and foci also grant attack and defense skills "for
    free." So what do we do, say, with a Graceful jack who gets Speed
    Defense from Graceful?</p>
  <p>A strict reading of the rules states that the jack is not
    allowed to take Speed Defense on tiering up until Tier 5, because
    she is already trained in it. However, this leads to a number of
    problems. Therefore, I have interpreted the rules loosely: I allow
    specialization in a skill if and once you receive it as a bonus from
    your descriptor or focus. There are three reasons for this call.</p>
  <p>First, it maintains character differentiation: our Graceful
    jack may retain her distinguishing advantage in Speed Defense
    relative to other characters even as she tiers up, and the other
    characters are able to pick Speed Defense as a tier perk.</p>
  <p>Second, this is not as big a difference with the strict reading
    as it appears at first glance. Many descriptors and foci grant
    defense (and sometimes attack) skills that are conditional and
    definitely do give specialization when the conditions apply; Trained
    Without Armor for example stacks with Speed Defense, giving
    Specialized in that when, well, without armor. So allowing "liberal"
    defense skill stacking doesn't change things as much as it might
    look at first glance.</p>
  <p>
    And third, enforcing the strict limits would have resulted in some
    collisions. For example, Masters Defense gets Intellect Defense for
    free on Tier 4, which jacks can pick as an ability any time before
    that, but are normally only allowed to specialize in it on Tier 5.
    So is a jack who picked it earlier specialized when he gets it from
    his focus, or not? If he is, then would he be allowed to pick it <i>after</i>
    receiving it from the focus, as a Tier 4 Trick of the Trade or
    purchased ability? If not, why the difference? In other words, I
    would have gotten into a mess of more judgment calls and more
    scripting to handle each potential collision in a fairly big matrix
    (descriptor, focus, type, tier-up bonus perk, tier-up bought perk).
    That, I'm fairly certain, would have just made things worse.
  </p>
  <p>In any case, this interpretation, like everything else, must
    ultimately be arbitrated by your GM and your group. If you want to
    enforce the strict interpretation, by all means do so â€“ simply don't
    take any of the problematic skills until the strict reading says
    you're allowed to.</p>
