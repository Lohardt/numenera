  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>The Character Creation Utility is for creating characters for
    Monte Cook Games' Numenera pen-and-paper role-playing game. You can
    create characters, advance them, and produce a printable character
    record for them. A lot of this probably won't make sense if you're
    not familiar with it. I'm assuming you have the Corebook and refer
    to it whenever you're confused; I'm not defining Numenera terms
    here.</p>
  <p>It requires a modern HTML5-capable browser such as Google
    Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. It will also work off-line
    on Chrome and Safari.</p>
  <h2>Buttons</h2>
  <p>The main application controls are in the button row at top.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> Clear
  </h3>
  <p>Closes the current character without saving, and returns to the
    splash pane.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-print"></i> Print
  </h3>
  <p>Opens the Print View. This is a printable character sheet. It
    should come out OK by printing it directly from your browser. Play
    with the scaling and fit to page options if you're having trouble.
    Click anywhere to return to the main view.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're using Firefox, it's a good idea to
    switch off the page headers and footers.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-fullscreen"></i> Play
  </h3>
  <p>Opens the Play View. It lets you track stat pools in play, take
    notes, quickly switch between party members, and do other in-play
    related stuff. It has its own help text. Please check it out too.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-save"></i> Save
  </h3>
  <p>Saves your character to your browser's local data store.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> Open
  </h3>
  <p>Opens the Character Manager, where you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display a list of links to your characters for sharing with
      other people</li>
    <li>Delete characters from the browser's data store</li>
    <li>Download a backup of your characters</li>
    <li>Restore characters from a backup</li>
    <li>Connect your Google Drive&trade;, which you can also use
      for backups and to sync your characters between devices</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-up"></i> Advance
  </h3>
  <p>Advances the character. Click this when you've finished with
    character creation and are ready to go into play, and every time
    you're ready to advance a tier. It won't do anything if the
    prerequisites aren't met.</p>
  <p>
    After you've finalized your character, you can advance her from the
    Advancement pane. Enter XP into the XP field, make your choices in
    the currently active tier, <i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Apply
    them, and make any stat adjustments you need to do. You can also
    swap out lower-tier abilities or customize your focus every time you
    go up a tier. After you've finished applying your changes and have
    enough XP to advance, click <i class="fa fa-angle-double-up"></i>
    Advance again, and repeat until out of tiers.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> GM Controls
  </h3>
  <p>Unlocks GM controls, which let you freely adjust stats, add
    special abilities, and change your character's Descriptor or Focus,
    even after she has advanced tiers.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> The Abilities pane has a GM control under the
    Additional Characteristics field. This will let you add Ⓐctions,
    Ⓔnablers, Ⓣtrained or Ⓢpecialized skills, Ⓜutations, and
    ︎Ⓘnabilities. If you use the the same name as a feature which
    affects stats, e.g. Ⓔ Ward or Ⓘ Weakness in Might, they will get
    applied in Play View or Print View.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Customize (only for un-Advanced
    characters)
  </h3>
  <p>Opens the Character Customizer, which lets you apply the
    optional Character Customization rules. This control will not be
    displayed for characters that have been advanced to play-ready. You
    can still customize the character's Focus from the Advancement tab
    every time you go up a tier.</p>
  <h2>How do I add another weapon?</h2>
  <p>Just enter it under Additional Equipment on its own line. If
    you include the same phrase as for your starting weapons (e.g. Heavy
    Bladed Weapon: Greatsword), it'll show up under Attacks on the Print
    and Play views.</p>
  <h2>What do those circled letters mean?</h2>
  <p>Ⓣrained, Ⓢpecialized, Ⓔnabler, Ⓐbility, Ⓘnability, Ⓛight,
    Ⓜedium, Ⓗeavy, Ⓑashing, Ⓒutting (or Ⓒleaving if you prefer), Ⓡanged,
    and ⓐsset.</p>
  <p>I substituted Ⓒutting for ⓑladed because Ⓑashing also starts
    with a Ⓑ.</p>
  <h2>How do I reach you?</h2>
