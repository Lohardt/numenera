  <h1>About Cypher Generator</h1>
  <p>The Cypher Generator generates random cyphers. It does not
    exactly duplicate the tables in the Corebook, although it does
    produce many similar cyphers. Thanks to the power of pseudorandom
    numbers, it is able to produce many thousands of unique cyphers with
    variable properties.</p>

    Be aware that it is <b>not</b> in conformance with the Numenera
    Rules as Written, and remains a work in progress.
