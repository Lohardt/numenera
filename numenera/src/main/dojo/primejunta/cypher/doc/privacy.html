    <ul>
      <li><strong>I do not want your data,</strong> and I do the
        absolute minimum with it that I have to, to be able to provide
        the features I do want.</li>
      <li><strong>I do not collect any personally
          identifiable data,</strong> beyond normal website traffic logging. If
        you arrived here via a link which contains data, I will be able
        to see that and where you came from, but that's all.</li>
      <li>I use cookies to make some features of the site "sticky"
        so you don't have to reset them every time you visit. <strong>These
          cookies contain no information beyond the ID and the setting,
          and I do not share them with anyone.</strong>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Your data is stored locally,</strong> in your
        browser's data store, except for Google Drive&trade; data (see
        below). It is not transmitted to the server, and I will not be
        able to see it.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Drive activity</strong> happens entirely
        between your browser and Google servers. I never see any of that
        traffic, nor do I transmit any of that information to my server.</li>
      <li>I do my best <strong>never to access any data on
          your Google Drive not created by this application.</strong> You can
        verify this by enabling your browser's debug console and
        following the traffic.
