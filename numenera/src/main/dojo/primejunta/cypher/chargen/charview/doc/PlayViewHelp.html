  <h1>Play View</h1>
  <p>This is a simple tool for displaying character data and
    tracking changes to pools while you play.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa pv-helpTitleIcon fa-user"></i> Background and notes
  </h3>
  <p>You can make changes to your background and notes. Changes will
    get written back to the character sheet, and they will get saved
    when you switch between characters.</p>
  <h3>
    <i class="fa pv-helpTitleIcon fa-dashboard"></i> In-play adjustments
  </h3>
  <p>
    Use the <i class="fa fa-plus-circle num-blueIcon"></i> and <i
      class="fa fa-minus-circle num-redIcon"></i> buttons to adjust your
    stats. They will be disabled if you hit zero or your character's
    maximum.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>XP:</b> XP will be written back to your character sheet when you
    close the Play View. If the control is grayed out, you haven't
    finalized your character yet with the Advance button. Go back to the
    main view and do that, then try again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Effort:</b> Set your level of effort from the Effort control at
    top. Then click <i class="fa fa-heart num-redIcon"></i> next to the
    stat for which you want to use it. The effort will be deducted from
    the stat, with Edge taken into account.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Damage track:</b> Moves up and down if any of your pools are at
    zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Recovery:</b> The recovery button is enabled (and turns blue) if
    your stats fall below their maximums. It cycles through A, 10 m, 1
    h, and 10 h depending on your next available recovery roll. The
    points will be distributed between your pools in an attempt to keep
    them relatively even. If you don't like this, adjust by hand with
    the <i class="fa fa-plus-circle num-blueIcon"></i> and <i
      class="fa fa-minus-circle num-redIcon"></i> buttons but don't
    cheat or your GM will get mad.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The utility does not account for the Special Healing
    needed by a hero who Fuses Flesh and Steel.
